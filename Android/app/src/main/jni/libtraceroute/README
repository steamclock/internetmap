traceroute host  - trace the route ip packets follow going to "host".

Attempt to trace the route an ip packet would follow to some
internet host.  We find out intermediate hops by launching probe
packets with a small ttl (time to live) then listening for an
icmp "time exceeded" reply from a gateway.  We start our probes
with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an icmp "port
unreachable" (which means we got to "host") or hit a max (which
defaults to net.inet.ip.ttl hops & can be changed with the -m flag).
Three probes (change with -q flag) are sent at each ttl setting and
a line is printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and
round trip time of each probe.  If the probe answers come from
different gateways, the address of each responding system will
be printed.  If there is no response within a 5 sec. timeout
interval (changed with the -w flag), a "*" is printed for that
probe.

Probe packets are UDP format.  We don't want the destination
host to process them so the destination port is set to an
unlikely value (if some clod on the destination is using that
value, it can be changed with the -p flag).

A sample use might be:

    [yak 71]% traceroute nis.nsf.net.
    traceroute to nis.nsf.net (35.1.1.48), 64 hops max, 56 byte packet
     1  helios.ee.lbl.gov (128.3.112.1)  19 ms  19 ms  0 ms
     2  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  39 ms  39 ms  19 ms
     3  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  39 ms  39 ms  19 ms
     4  ccngw-ner-cc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.136.23)  39 ms  40 ms  39 ms
     5  ccn-nerif22.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.168.22)  39 ms  39 ms  39 ms
     6  128.32.197.4 (128.32.197.4)  40 ms  59 ms  59 ms
     7  131.119.2.5 (131.119.2.5)  59 ms  59 ms  59 ms
     8  129.140.70.13 (129.140.70.13)  99 ms  99 ms  80 ms
     9  129.140.71.6 (129.140.71.6)  139 ms  239 ms  319 ms
    10  129.140.81.7 (129.140.81.7)  220 ms  199 ms  199 ms
    11  nic.merit.edu (35.1.1.48)  239 ms  239 ms  239 ms

Note that lines 2 & 3 are the same.  This is due to a buggy
kernel on the 2nd hop system -- lbl-csam.arpa -- that forwards
packets with a zero ttl.

A more interesting example is:

    [yak 72]% traceroute allspice.lcs.mit.edu.
    traceroute to allspice.lcs.mit.edu (18.26.0.115), 64 hops max

    11  129.140.72.17 (129.140.72.17)  300 ms  239 ms  239 ms
    12  * * *
    13  128.121.54.72 (128.121.54.72)  259 ms  499 ms  279 ms

(I start to see why I'm having so much trouble with mail to
MIT.)  Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 & 17 hops away
either don't send ICMP "time exceeded" messages or send them
with a ttl too small to reach us.  14 - 17 are running the
MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send "time exceeded"s.  God
only knows what's going on with 12.

The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in
the 4.[23]BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3)
sends an unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the
original datagram.  Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is
zero, the icmp "time exceeded" is guaranteed to not make it back
to us.  The behavior of this bug is slightly more interesting
when it appears on the destination system:

     1  helios.ee.lbl.gov (128.3.112.1)  0 ms  0 ms  0 ms
     2  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  39 ms  19 ms  39 ms
     3  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  19 ms  39 ms  19 ms
     4  ccngw-ner-cc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.136.23)  39 ms  40 ms  19 ms
     5  ccn-nerif35.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.168.35)  39 ms  39 ms  39 ms
     6  csgw.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.133.254)  39 ms  59 ms  39 ms
     7  * * *
     8  * * *
     9  * * *
    10  * * *
    11  * * *
    12  * * *
    13  rip.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.131.22)  59 ms !  39 ms !  39 ms !

Notice that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final
destination) and exactly the last half of them are "missing".
What's really happening is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5)
is using the ttl from our arriving datagram as the ttl in its
icmp reply.  So, the reply will time out on the return path
(with no notice sent to anyone since icmp's aren't sent for
icmp's) until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path
length.  I.e., rip is really only 7 hops away.  A reply that
returns with a ttl of 1 is a clue this problem exists.
Traceroute prints a "!" after the time if the ttl is <= 1.
Since vendors ship a lot of obsolete (DEC's Ultrix, Sun 3.x) or
non-standard (HPUX) software, expect to see this problem
frequently and/or take care picking the target host of your
probes.

Other possible annotations after the time are !H, !N, !P (got a host,
network or protocol unreachable, respectively), !S or !F (source
route failed or fragmentation needed -- neither of these should
ever occur and the associated gateway is busted if you see one).  If
almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable, traceroute
will give up and exit.

Notes
-----
This program must be run by root or be setuid.  (I suggest that
you *don't* make it setuid -- casual use could result in a lot
of unnecessary traffic on our poor, congested nets.)

This program requires a kernel mod that does not appear in any
system available from Berkeley:  A raw ip socket using proto
IPPROTO_RAW must interpret the data sent as an ip datagram (as
opposed to data to be wrapped in a ip datagram).  See the README
file that came with the source to this program for a description
of the mods I made to /sys/netinet/raw_ip.c.  Your mileage may
vary.  But, again, ANY 4.x (x < 4) BSD KERNEL WILL HAVE TO BE
MODIFIED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM.

The udp port usage may appear bizarre (well, ok, it is bizarre).
The problem is that an icmp message only contains 8 bytes of
data from the original datagram.  8 bytes is the size of a udp
header so, if we want to associate replies with the original
datagram, the necessary information must be encoded into the
udp header (the ip id could be used but there's no way to
interlock with the kernel's assignment of ip id's and, anyway,
it would have taken a lot more kernel hacking to allow this
code to set the ip id).  So, to allow two or more users to
use traceroute simultaneously, we use this task's pid as the
source port (the high bit is set to move the port number out
of the "likely" range).  To keep track of which probe is being
replied to (so times and/or hop counts don't get confused by a
reply that was delayed in transit), we increment the destination
port number before each probe.

Don't use this as a coding example.  I was trying to find a
routing problem and this code sort-of popped out after 48 hours
without sleep.  I was amazed it ever compiled, much less ran.

I stole the idea for this program from Steve Deering.  Since
the first release, I've learned that had I attended the right
IETF working group meetings, I also could have stolen it from Guy
Almes or Matt Mathis.  I don't know (or care) who came up with
the idea first.  I envy the originators' perspicacity and I'm
glad they didn't keep the idea a secret.

Tim Seaver, Ken Adelman and C. Philip Wood provided bug fixes and/or
enhancements to the original distribution.

I've hacked up a round-trip-route version of this that works by
sending a loose-source-routed udp datagram through the destination
back to yourself.  Unfortunately, SO many gateways botch source
routing, the thing is almost worthless.  Maybe one day...
