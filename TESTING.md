# InternetMap - General Testing Guidelines

### High Priority
- **The Map** should be populated with data, zooming and panning should work as expected
- **Traceroutes** should work, and highlight their path through the map
- **Node selection** should work on a handful of nodes
- **Globe and Network views** of the map should both work.
- **Searching** domains and company names should work.

### Medium Priority
- **The "i" menu** should work and its subitems should all load working pages.
- **Browsing historical data** should show the explainer populs and shrink/grow the number of nodes shown.
- **iPhone and iPad** should both work - node selection in particular displays differently on the two device types.
- **You Are Here* function** should work as expected

### Low Priority
- **Contact form** should function
- **First Use** intro screen and tips for calling out different functions should work
- **Performance** should be reasonable on slowest supported device

### Standard Testing Guidelines

- App should generally follow platform UI best practices and guidelines
- Layout should work correctly on the supported device sizes (iPhone SE, iPhone 6+, iPhone X)
- Views should respond reasonably to slow and unavailable network conditions
- UI transitions should be smooth and to platform conventions
- Performance should be acceptable on slowest supported device (i.e. iPhone 5)
